Horiseon Refactor

For the Horiseon Refactor project I updated the HTML and CSS code for the Horiseon website, with the goal of restructuring and consolidating the code 
to conform with modern standards, without modifying the appearance, layout, or content. 

Edited HTML tags to modernize and simplify semantics. 
Consolidated HTML tag classes in order to simplify CSS.
Added accessibility elements, including descriptive title and image alt attributes. 

Simplified CSS elements to conform to HTML semantics.
Consolidated CSS file to remove repetition based on changed made to HTML class tags.
Added comments throughout CSS file to clarify sections and elements. 

This project was a good refresher on basic HTML and CSS, and a way to learn newer methods and semantics. 
This project also served as a learning experience for GitHub use and Bash commands.
See Git Commit messages for much greater detail about change history throughout this project. 

Challenge: I had to occassionally turn elements red to convince myself that I was still talking to the correct files and viewing the correct
website, as the goal was to NOT see anything change.
